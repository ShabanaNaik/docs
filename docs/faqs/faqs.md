  <summary>How does Amplication work?</summary>
  
  You just need to define your data models, roles, and permissions, and Amplication will generate a TypeScript Node.js application with everything you need already baked in. This includes fully functional REST API and GraphQL API for all your data models, authentication, role-based authorization, logging, and even an admin UI.

<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between the Community Edition and the Enterprise Edition?</summary>

  
  **Community Edition (CE)** – contains Amplication's core functionality. It is open-source and free to use for the whole community. The Amplication Community Edition continues to be licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/blob/master/LICENSE).

  **Enterprise Edition (EE)** - adds advanced operations, security, and commercially orientated features. The Enterprise Edition is built on top of the Community Edition and the additional functionality will be supplied as source-available. While users can view and download the code, ownership of the platform code remains with Amplication, meaning users cannot resell it. Use of the Amplication Enterprise Edition is subject to the Amplication [Terms of Service](https://amplication.com/terms)

  <summary>Is Amplication a no-code solution?</summary>
  
Amplication is a platform for professional developers, enabling you to automate repetitive tasks, eliminating or reducing the time spent on repetitive server-side tasks and boilerplate code. Your developer skills are very much required to create your hand-crafted business logic, so it is definitely NOT a no-code solution. Amplication reduces the amount of code you need to write, hence some may call it a low-code solution for professional developers.
